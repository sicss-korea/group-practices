# Guidelines

## Discussion 

1. How is prediction different from description or causation?

2. Read the PNAS paper (https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1915006117) on the fragile family project.

3. Discuss the implications of the main research output: "the best predictions were not very accurate and were only slightly better than those from a simple benchmark model."

4.1. Prediction is a function of what? (e.g., data quality, problem difficulty, algorithm performance) 

4.2. Does the common task method help examine prediction's value in social science research? 

## Group activity 

There are three types of mass collaboration ("Human computation," "Open calls," "Distributed data collection") defined by the textbook. 

- Human computation (e.g., Galaxy Zoo, Crow-coding political manifesto): easy task big scale problem
- Open call (Netflix Prize, Foldit, Peer-to-Patent): novel and unexpected answers to clearly formulated problems
- Distributed data collection (e.g., eBird, PhotoCity, Malawi Journals Project): large-scale data collection

1. Pick a type of mass collaboration and design a research project based on it. 

1.1. What is the research question?

1.2. How does the selected mass collaboration framework apply to the research question?

2. Next, identify technical (e.g., building a tool) and human challenges (e.g., motivating participants) related to your proposed project. 

3. Then, discuss how you can overcome them. 

4. Finally, examine any ethical considerations in implementing your proposed project.
