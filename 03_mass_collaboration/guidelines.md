# Guidelines

There are three types of mass collaboration ("Human computation," "Open calls," "Distributed data collection") defined by the textbook. 

- Human computation (e.g., Galaxy Zoo, Crow-coding political manifesto): easy task big scale problem
- Open call (Netflix Prize, Foldit, Peer-to-Patent): novel and unexpected answers to clearly formulated problems
- Distributed data collection (e.g., eBird, PhotoCity, Malawi Journals Project): large-scale data collection

1. Pick a type of mass collaboration and design a research project based on it. 

1.1. What is the research question?

1.2. How does the selected mass collaboration framework apply to the research question?

2. Next, identify technical (e.g., building a tool) and human challenges (e.g., motivating participants) related to your proposed project. 

3. Then, discuss how you can overcome them. 

4. Finally, examine any ethical considerations in implementing your proposed project.
